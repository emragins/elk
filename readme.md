##Introduction

### What is it?
Windows Event Log Querying Utility

### How do I use it?
Well, ideally 

### What does it support?
* Querying Windows Event Logs
* Configuration on an "opt-in" basis via your app.config or web.config
* Remote Event Logs
* Filtering:
	* Date Range
	* Time Ago (ex. in the last 2 days)
	* Built-in Log Levels

### What doesn't it support?
* Remote user authentication
* Custom Log Levels
* Filtering:
	* Log Contents

### Why the name?
Event Log Viewer => Elv (huh?) => Elves (nah) => Elk (works for me)

## Putting it to Use
*To be completed later*

## Future Plans
* Easy MVC Integration
* Filtering by log contents via the above

(there are no current plans for remote user authentication)
